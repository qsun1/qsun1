- 🔭 I’m a CS PhD student at City University of Hong Kong. I am generally interested in computer vision, graphics and machine learning. My recent research focuses on the representation and generation of objects/scenes for 3D and 4D content creation.
I am fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Jing Liao. I am mentored by [Guandao Yang](https://www.guandaoyang.com/), [Ziyu Wan](http://raywzy.com/), [Can Wang](https://cassiepython.github.io/) and [Hang Zhou](https://ryanhangzhou.github.io/) whose help and support I cannot appreciate enough.
- :satellite: Before that, I learned astrophyics at USTC.
